AJM: Hi there! I'd be happy to help with your Python script. Please provide the error message you're seeing and a snippet of the relevant code. Here are a few common steps to troubleshoot Python errors:

Check the Error Message: Python error messages usually tell you where the problem is. Look at the last line of the error message first.
Review the Code: Look at the line indicated in the error message and the lines around it.
Syntax Errors: Ensure there are no syntax errors such as missing colons, parentheses, or indentation issues.
Variable Names: Make sure all variables are correctly named and initialized before use.
Imports: Check that all necessary modules are imported at the beginning of your script.
If you share the error message and code, I can provide more specific guidance!
